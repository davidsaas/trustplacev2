  "title": "Is It Safer For A Woman Who Lives Alone To Live In A Condo That's Higher Up Vs A Single Family Family Home in LA? Any Single Women Live In a SFH In LA &amp; Do You Feel Safe?",
  "communityName": "r/AskLosAngeles",
  "parsedCommunityName": "AskLosAngeles",
  "body": "I  may be in a position to afford a home in the next few years in LA by myself. I will be living alone with no plan to move anyone in.\n\nSFH are a better choice as they appreciate in value faster, tend to sell faster if I decide to sell etc, a little bit more ideal than buying a condo or apartment due to not having adjoining walls. However, most homes have multiple entry break-in points. There's also a lot of homeless people in LA and I've heard stories about people having homeless folks sleeping in their patio etc so it seems very scary to be honest also with the uptick in robberies recently etc.\n\nI've only lived in apartments my entire life and currently live one that is on a higher level. I feel much safer as one needs an key fob to get through the front door etc. I also feel like I'm safer as i'm in a higher floor level and not likely to get robbed.\n\nHas any woman here lived in a single family house all alone in LA and if so did/do you feel safe?",

I lived in an apt in Burbank for 17 years and never once did I feel unsafe.  I moved to a house in Sun Valley, had bars on the windows, spiked fence all around, you better believe I put alarms on every window but still wondered everyday I came home if that was the day it had been ransacked or burned to the ground.

(didn't kill him, just tasered him.)  \n\nSo even in \"nice\" neighborhoods the occasional oddity can occur, and the reason I mentioned at the start that I was a grown ass man was because yeah, I've been scared sometimes, too.  You don't have to be a woman to be concerned for your safety.  I get it, but don't think that's the only reason you should be concerned.  \n\nJust do your research, pick the right neighborhood, if you feel you need it get a security system, some pepper spray and if you're so inclined a gun.  (That's your call, not everyone would agree.)  I will add this: if you can afford it, maybe look into a gated community.  Sounds snobby, I used to to think so myself until I feared for my safety everyday, but now I'm happy to live in a place with a gate and guards patrolling the grounds 24/7.  It's not an absolute guarantee obviously but it does increase your comfort level.  If you go condo/townhome make sure it's a place with guards or a secured complex.  \n\nBottom line, you do what makes you feel safest and best.  It's your life and you decide what's right for you.",

People lose them or can easily get them stolen for stranger access. Ever get your purse and keys stolen? Likely they have your ID and now have access to the building....\n\nSo, I wouldn't necessarily consider any place safe. It's about the protections you can take to make it safer.

  "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my first apartment, I chased a dude out who was climbing in my window at 130am.  Building was gated but guess what, we had an outside escape staircase that he hopped the fence and got in through. key fobs are like eeeeh to me. People lose them or can easily get them stolen for stranger access. Ever get your purse and keys stolen? Likely they have your ID and now have access to the building....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily consider any place safe. It&amp;#39;s about the protections you can take to make it safer.  I often house sit for coworkers and stay alone in their SFH.

I was walking my dogs the other day and got this huge wash of fake cologne smell. I instantly became hyper alert because I knew there was a man somewhere but I couldn't tell where. Turns out he was in his car with his window down and a huge erection. I have never had anything like that happen to me before and literally down the block from where I live. Felt so gross and uncomfortable the rest of my walk.\n\nStill I'd say I feel comfortable walking around during the day but that's because I have always been used to walking around alert and ready to defend myself. I won't ever, ever walk alone at night anymore though. Used to walk down Santa Monica at like 1am after work at the begining of 2020 but I look back at that and think I was crazy to do that.",

  "html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in East Hollywood and I walk my dogs around my neighborhood and run up to Franklin. I&amp;#39;m fairly small myself (5&amp;#39;2&amp;quot;, 128) and definitely ALWAYS aware of my surroundings. I was walking my dogs the other day and got this huge wash of fake cologne smell. I instantly became hyper alert because I knew there was a man somewhere but I couldn&amp;#39;t tell where. Turns out he was in his car with his window down and a huge erection. I have never had anything like that happen to me before and literally down the block from where I live. Felt so gross and uncomfortable the rest of my walk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still I&amp;#39;d say I feel comfortable walking around during the day but that&amp;#39;s because I have always been used to walking around alert and ready to defend myself. I won&amp;#39;t ever, ever walk alone at night anymore though. Used to walk down Santa Monica at like 1am after work at the begining of 2020 but I look back at that and think I was crazy to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

In the day time I wouldn&amp;#39;t wear headphones and just made sure I was aware of my surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve experienced a significantly higher amount of sexual harassment since moving to NoHo. I&amp;#39;ve had men follow me home, follow me in their cars, scream things at me, and make lewd gestures. One man rode by on a bike and attempted to grope me as he went by. This is all during daylight hours while walking my dog. I never experienced this in WeHo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As bad as WeHo has gotten with safety, many other neighborhoods aren&amp;#39;t much better unless you are somewhere super nice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Concerned by all the stories I've heard of random people being attacked when walking about etc what are the actual chances of this happening? \n\nWhich main question is which would be the absolute safest area to stay in?\nI was looking at hotels in Beverly Hills/ West Hollywood as these constantly came up as recommendations however when I asked on another social media earlier most people said WeHo could be a bit sketchy. The same has also been said about Santa Monica in lots of posts but then it has been recommended in others so have no clue what to believe. I'm also confused why everyone was suggesting SM or Marina Del Rey for safety but then suggesting avoiding Venice, are these places not right next to each other??  \nIs BH/WeHo fine to carry on looking at? Or other areas such as Culver city or Los Feliz better? \nI don't really have anything in particular I want to see other than WB studios which is a one-off thing so don't care how long I need to travel for that but other than that probably just going to see a beach, maybe Melrose/Sunset etc whatever seems nearby and accessible.

But there underground clubs on spring that stay until 5am. So there’s always people up, also LA Cafe is open 24 hours so that’s always a place to call Uber that’s well lit. But also, as I said drunk people getting out at clubs also isn’t the safest for a woman alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

  "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m originally from New York City and recently moved to Los Angeles about three years ago. My current place is in the Financial District of Downtown LA, and while I appreciate the city vibe, I’m looking for a change. I love LA for its laid-back, relaxed atmosphere compared to NYC’s fast pace, but I want to find a neighborhood that’s a bit safer, cleaner, and more suited to my preferences.\n\nI’m a woman in my 20s, and I enjoy being around people and having walkable access to amenities. My budget is $3500 a month, and I’d prefer a diverse area where I can still experience that vibrant, urban feel but with less of the grit and more of a clean environment.\n\nI’ve considered Koreatown, but I’ve heard mixed things and want to avoid making the same mistake I did with Downtown LA. I’m looking for neighborhoods that are lively but not too chaotic, where it’s safe to be out and about at night, and where there’s a good mix of people and amenities.\n\nAny recommendations for neighborhoods that fit this description? I’d love to hear about your experiences, including both pros and cons. Thanks!",

  "body": "Where I live in Larchmont/Windsor Square would meet a lot of your criteria! Beautiful, historic apartments (many of which are under your budget) located in a gorgeous tree lined neighborhood which is walking distance to many shops and restaurants in Larchmont Village. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful while still being located directly next to more urban, dense neighborhoods like Koreatown, East Hollywood, and Miracle Mile. You’re also only a 20 ish min drive from the east side and DTLA. Also, you have direct access to bus lines and a nearby metro station in Ktown. The only con I would say is that the neighborhood can be somewhat small, and car thefts and minor petty crimes occasionally occur due to being located in the middle of central LA. But overall, feel super happy and safe living where I do! Truly a hidden gem.",

  "body": "The most obvious answer may be \"lol no\", but I thought I'd still ask the people that live there or used to live there. Considering moving to DTLA and there are quite a few good reasons to (walking distance to work, easier commute to the beach, somewhat lower rent compared to where I live now, etc.); the only factor that really concerns me is safety. I work in DTLA and see some weird shit there on the daily, and I mean, we are all aware of the homelessness/mental health/drug problem that doesn't seem to get any better, I guess my question is, does it actually translate into unsafe living conditions, especially for a woman living alone? I also see a lot of people that seem to live in the area, walking their dogs in the morning, etc., so that makes me think maybe I'm worrying too much. And not that I go out much alone after dark anyway, but I just wouldn't want to be stuck somewhere for a year and hate it because I can't even take a peek outside after dark, lol. What do you think? TIA.",

I will have a car in LA, but I'd still like to walk around by myself and explore a bit without getting mugged/purse snatched/ etc (my mom's worry). I know the church I'd like to attend is walking distance, stuff like that.\n\nThey don't want me to go out at night but I plan on, you know, living and seeing shows I don't have access to here (coughUCBcough) and if I'm able to get a part time job it'll probably be at night due to my internship hours. \n\nAnyway, I'll mainly be around the Los Feliz, Silver Lake, and what google maps is just calling Hollywood areas. Zipcodes 90027 and 90028. Where I'm living is around the corner from the Chinese Theatre, if that helps. How safe are these areas (day and night)?\nI've looked at crimemapping and the LA Times crime map, but I'd like to know what redditors have to say.\n\nSo, if you have any tips or quirky things I should know about living, surviving (or even driving, since I've heard about the LA traffic nightmares which I know are way less than anything I've ever had to deal with) in LA please bring 'em on!\nI'd just like to keep all my money, possessions, and limbs for the summer ;)   \nThanks!  \n",

  "body": "In general I wouldn't worry about safety, there is a saying here in LA, that danger does not find you, like it might in east coast cities (see [*Swingers*](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=swinger's+movie&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8#rls=en&amp;q=swingers+movie), for one). In almost 2 decades I've never been mugged in LA or had any friends who have been mugged, and although I'm a guy, I do walk alone late at night all the time and have lived in a lot more dangerous neighborhoods than I'm sure you will even step foot in (such as USC and MacArthur Park). So while mothers worry (lord knows mine does), and while of course violence and muggings do happen, chances are very low that it will happen to you, **IF** you are not walking around oblivious with prada bags and diamond necklaces down dark alleys trying to buy drugs, or ridiculous variations thereof. If someone does try to mug you, just give them your purse and your phone, don't worry about those things, you can get new ones. If you hand it over willingly, 99% chance they won't hurt you, they just want money.\n\nLos Feliz and Silverlake are very safe. As for Hollywood, well the residents of Hollywood are normally not a problem, but I'm about to rant about Hollywood as a place to live. Hollywood is fun to visit, but I could never personally live there or recommend anyone else to, who does not know exactly what they are getting into.\n\nHollywood gets tons of drunk people driving in from all parts of LA late at night, who get in fights with each other, and occasionally they bring guns unfortunately. The likelihood that you will be shot or hurt by these idiots is very very low. Basically that's the tourism capital of LA, and tourists come here every day, and 99.9% of them walk away unscathed. Where you will be living is not an unsafe area, but it is in the heart of the drunken club scene. One place that has become notorious for this in the last couple years is a venue called [SupperClub](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=supperclub+hollywood+shootings&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8). Use common sense, if you see fights or commotion breaking out, stay away. But they reason I wouldn't personally live in Hollywood if I were you, isn't necessarily a danger thing (although that does factor in) but more because all the chaos of Hollywood Blvd can be super annoying. It's a fun place to live if you want to party at all those bars and clubs, or if you are in a band and want to stay up doing blow and playing loud music at all hours, and want to live in a place where you can get away with that, but I have a gym membership at the LA Fitness on Hollywood/Sycamore, and even just going to the gym there can be the most annoying thing in the world, the streets are shut down for movie premiers, there are tourists blocking the sidewalks taking photos with every costume character from Chewbacca to Spiderman to Spongebob, at night there are drunk douches walking around acting like bros, and rude entitled drunk bimbos in heels they can barely stand up in, right next to armies of maybe German or midwest tourists with fanny packs and Rodeo Drive tshirts waiting in line to take the TMZ tour bus to celeb homes, right next to paparazzi fighting to snap photos of reality show b-celebs rushing from limo to bottle service, right next to overworked police who are handing out jaywalking tickets and harassing the many homeless who seem to live eat sleep and pee all over the sidewalks. This is the walk of fame where you will be living. I don't want to say it's terrible unsafe, but I would recommend looking for a different place to live. I live in the Los Feliz area and love it. It's quiet. There is lots of hiking nearby, yet there are still great bars and restaurants if you want to do that sort of thing, but here the bars have to respect their neighbors, no loud people on the streets, a lot less commotion. Depending what you are looking for you will either love or completely hate Hollywood. Sorry for the rant, but I just thought you should know what you are getting into.",
