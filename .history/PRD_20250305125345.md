# Airbnb Safety Report - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The Airbnb Safety Report tool allows users to input an Airbnb listing URL for a location in NYC or LA and receive a comprehensive safety report. The tool analyzes the safety features of the listing, provides safety metrics from OpenStreetMap, extracts safety-related reviews, and suggests safer alternatives at similar price points.

## Problem Statement
Travelers are often concerned about the safety of their accommodations when booking on Airbnb, especially in large cities like NYC and LA. Currently, there is no easy way to:
1. Assess the safety of an Airbnb listing based on location
2. Find safety-focused reviews from previous guests
3. Compare safety metrics with other similar properties in the area
4. Make informed decisions about accommodation safety

## Target Users
- Travelers planning trips to NYC or LA
- Safety-conscious individuals
- Families with children or elderly members
- Solo travelers, especially women
- First-time visitors to NYC or LA

## User Flows

### Main User Flow
1. User lands on the home page
2. User signs up/logs in via Supabase Auth
3. User is directed to the home page with a search input
4. User pastes an Airbnb listing URL
5. System processes the URL and generates a safety report
6. User views the safety report with metrics, reviews, and alternatives
7. User can save the report (premium feature)

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks "Sign Up" or "Log In" on the landing page
2. User completes the Supabase authentication process
3. User is redirected back to the application
4. System records the user's authentication status
